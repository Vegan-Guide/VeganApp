Also there will be able to have vegan recipes, with all the community helping each other, adding new places and recipes, and with feedback of ratings, favorite and comments, making it more reliable and trustful to everyone. Using Flutter as main language of development, so it can be easly integrated to firebase tools as the firestore and user authentification.
